# WhatWord

A program in C / C++ to create a 4x4 Boggle board and play on the command line..

You play against the clock to see how many words you can find using adjacent letters on the  
board.  Each letter can be used only once for a given word.

The program was an assignment for CS 141 at UIC. The assignment can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/cs141fall2016/programs/prog-5-whatword

The assignment was given to help students learn how recursion works. Recursion was used to 
find all possible words on the board.
